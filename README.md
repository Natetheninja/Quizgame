#QUIZ GAME
A simple html5 system with multiple html files. It's setup in a super simple way, making it easy for anyone to use. You can make both quiz games and text adventure games with this simple system.
#HOW IT WORKS
It works by having the main HTML file be a sort of main menu, which hosts the links to the other html files. Each question hosts files called "w-.htm" and c-.html" (where the "-" is would be a number). These files, if not already obvious, are Wrong and Correct. Each question contains one or more of these files, depending on the question/question types. To make it even more simple, you could create a script or something to were you just use one file with multiple links but the scripts hides them depending on the question you are on. (That was confusing so i am not going to elaborate any further)
#WHY
Because I was bored and wanted to make a game, but ultimatly decided to make a simple game template.
